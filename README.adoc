This guide walks you through the process of creating a "`Hello, World`" Hypermedia-driven
REST web service with Spring.

{wikipedia-hateoas}[Hypermedia] is an important aspect of REST. It lets you build services
that decouple client and server to a large extent and let them evolve independently. The
representations returned for REST resources contain not only data but also links to
related resources. Thus, the design of the representations is crucial to the design of the
overall service.

== What You Will Build

You will build a hypermedia-driven REST service with Spring HATEOAS: a library of APIs
that you can use to create links that point to Spring MVC controllers, build up resource
representations, and control how they are rendered into supported hypermedia formats (such
as HAL).

The service will accept HTTP GET requests at `http://localhost:8080/greeting`.

It will respond with a JSON representation of a greeting that is enriched with the
simplest possible hypermedia element, a link that points to the resource itself. The
following listing shows the output:

====
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "content":"Hello, World!",
  "_links":{
    "self":{
      "href":"http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=World"
    }
  }
}
----
====

The response already indicates that you can customize the greeting with an optional `name`
parameter in the query string, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User
----
====

The `name` parameter value overrides the default value of `World` and is reflected in the
response, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "content":"Hello, User!",
  "_links":{
    "self":{
      "href":"http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User"
    }
  }
}
----
====

== Starting with Spring Initializr

You can use this https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&groupId=com.example&artifactId=rest-hateoas&name=rest-hateoas&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.rest-hateoas&dependencies=hateoas[pre-initialized project] and click Generate to download a ZIP file. This project is configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.

To manually initialize the project:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Spring HATEOAS*.
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

NOTE: You can also fork the project from Github and open it in your IDE or other editor.

== Create a Resource Representation Class

Now that you have set up the project and build system, you can create your web service.

Begin the process by thinking about service interactions.

The service will expose a resource at `/greeting` to handle `GET` requests, optionally
with a `name` parameter in the query string. The `GET` request should return a `200 OK`
response with JSON in the body to represent a greeting.

Beyond that, the JSON representation of the resource will be enriched with a list of
hypermedia elements in a `_links` property. The most rudimentary form of this is a link
that points to the resource itself. The representation should resemble the following
listing:

====
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "content":"Hello, World!",
  "_links":{
    "self":{
      "href":"http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=World"
    }
  }
}
----
====

The `content` is the textual representation of the greeting. The `_links` element contains
a list of links (in this case, exactly one with the relation type of `self` and the `href`
attribute pointing to the resource that was accessed).

To model the greeting representation, create a resource representation class. As the
`_links` property is a fundamental property of the representation model, Spring HATEOAS
ships with a base class (called `RepresentationModel`) that lets you add instances of `Link`
and ensures that they are rendered as shown earlier.

Create a plain old java object that extends `RepresentationModel` and adds the field and
accessor for the content as well as a constructor, as the following listing (from
`src/main/java/com/example/resthateoas/Greeting.java`) shows:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/resthateoas/Greeting.java[]
----
====

* @JsonCreator: Signals how Jackson can create an instance of this POJO.
* @JsonProperty: Marks the field into which Jackson should put this constructor argument.

NOTE: As you will see in later in this guide, Spring will use the Jackson JSON library to
automatically marshal instances of type `Greeting` into JSON.

Next, create the resource controller that will serve these greetings.

== Create a REST Controller

In Spring's approach to building RESTful web services, HTTP requests are handled by a
controller. The components are identified by the {RestController}[`@RestController`]
annotation, which combines the {Controller}[`@Controller`] and
{ResponseBody}[`@ResponseBody`] annotations. The following `GreetingController` (from
`src/main/java/com/example/resthateoas/GreetingController.java`) handles `GET` requests
for `/greeting` by returning a new instance of the `Greeting` class:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/resthateoas/GreetingController.java[]
----
====

This controller is concise and simple, but there is plenty going on. We break it down step
by step.

The `@RequestMapping` annotation ensures that HTTP requests to `/greeting` are mapped to
the `greeting()` method.

NOTE: The above example does not specify `GET` vs. `PUT`, `POST`, and so forth, because `@RequestMapping` maps _all_ HTTP operations by default. Use `@GetMapping("/greeting")` to narrow this mapping. In that case you also want to `import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;`.

`@RequestParam` binds the value of the query string parameter `name` into the `name` parameter of the `greeting()` method. This query string parameter is implicitly not `required` because of the use of the `defaultValue` attribute. If it is absent in the request, the `defaultValue` of `World` is used.

Because the `@RestController` annotation is present on the class, an implicit
{ResponseBody}[`@ResponseBody`] annotation is added to the `greeting` method. This causes
Spring MVC to render the returned `HttpEntity` and its payload (the `Greeting`) directly
to the response.

The most interesting part of the method implementation is how you create the link that
points to the controller method and how you add it to the representation model. Both
`linkTo(…)` and `methodOn(…)` are static methods on `ControllerLinkBuilder` that let you
fake a method invocation on the controller. The returned `LinkBuilder` will have inspected
the controller method's mapping annotation to build up exactly the URI to which the method
is mapped.

NOTE: Spring HATEOAS respects various `X-FORWARDED-` headers. If you put a Spring HATEOAS
service behind a proxy and properly configure it with `X-FORWARDED-HOST` headers, the
resulting links will be properly formatted.

The call to `withSelfRel()` creates a `Link` instance that you add to the `Greeting`
representation model.

Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.

== Test the Service

Now that the service is up, visit http://localhost:8080/greeting, where you should see the
following content:

====
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "content":"Hello, World!",
  "_links":{
    "self":{
      "href":"http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=World"
    }
  }
}
----
====

Provide a `name` query string parameter by visiting the following URL:
`http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User`. Notice how the value of the `content`
attribute changes from `Hello, World!` to `Hello, User!` and the `href` attribute of the
`self` link reflects that change as well, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "content":"Hello, User!",
  "_links":{
    "self":{
      "href":"http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User"
    }
  }
}
----
====

This change demonstrates that the `@RequestParam` arrangement in `GreetingController`
works as expected. The `name` parameter has been given a default value of `World` but can
always be explicitly overridden through the query string.

== Summary

Congratulations! You have just developed a hypermedia-driven RESTful web service with
Spring HATEOAS.
